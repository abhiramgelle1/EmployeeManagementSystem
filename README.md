e-BPM Portal with robust feature sets

e - Business Process Management Portal [e-BPM Portal] WebApplication

The main objective of e-BPM Portal is to optimize business processes to make them more
efficient and also to ensure that they are robust enough so that tasks do not "fall through the
cracks".
Often business processes have been in place for many years, and have been set up before the
people who currently undertake these processes even worked at the organization. In large
organizations, these processes can be affected by inertia and are very hard to change. In these
cases, large projects are often undertaken to modernize these processes taking new technology
and best practices into account.
It helps organizationsto identify all the processes in their organization, capture them, modelling
change to analyses the likelihood of success and implementing change.
The results will often automate tedious tasks and free employees from paperwork in order that
they may focus more on special cases and exception management.
A company can have thousands of processes and making them all run more efficiently could
save a business a good amount of time and money.
